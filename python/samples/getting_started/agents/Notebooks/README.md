- Agent coordination and handoffs
- State management in workflows

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**
   ```bash
   # Python 3.10 or higher
   python --version
   ```

2. **Install Agent Framework**
   ```bash
   # Base installation
   pip install agent-framework
   
   # With Azure AI support
   pip install agent-framework[azure-ai]
   
   # Or install everything
   pip install agent-framework[all]
   ```

3. **Install Jupyter**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter notebook
   # Or use JupyterLab
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

4. **Azure Authentication**
   ```bash
   # For Azure-based notebooks
   az login
   ```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `python` directory (5 levels up from Notebooks):

```bash
# For Azure OpenAI Chat Completion
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-10-21  # Optional

# For Azure AI Foundry
AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://<your-project>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-id>
AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o-mini

# Optional: For direct API key authentication (if not using Azure CLI)
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Launch Jupyter**
   ```bash
   # From this directory
   jupyter notebook
   # Or with JupyterLab
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Open a Notebook**
   - Click on any `.ipynb` file
   - Run cells sequentially with `Shift+Enter`
   - Or use "Run All" from the menu

3. **Using VS Code**
   - Open the notebook in VS Code
   - VS Code will prompt to install Jupyter extension if needed
   - Select your Python kernel
   - Run cells interactively

## üìä Visualization Features

The **Concurrent Workflow Demo** includes three methods for rendering Mermaid diagrams directly in notebooks:

1. **Mermaid.js via CDN** - JavaScript-based rendering
2. **Mermaid.ink API** - Image-based rendering (most reliable)
3. **Optional Packages** - Native Jupyter extensions

All methods are provided with working code examples!

## üí° Tips for Learning

1. **Start with Azure OpenAI Chat Completion** - Easiest to set up
2. **Progress to Azure AI Foundry** - More advanced persistence features
3. **Explore Workflows** - Multi-agent orchestration patterns
4. **Experiment with Tools** - Modify function tools to see how agents adapt

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure packages are installed
pip install agent-framework[azure-ai]

# Verify installation
python -c "import agent_framework; print(agent_framework.__version__)"
```

### Environment Variable Issues
```bash
# Check if .env file is in the correct location
# Should be in: python/.env (5 directories up from Notebooks)

# Verify variables are loaded
python -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; import os; load_dotenv(); print(os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT'))"
```

### Authentication Errors
```bash
# Re-authenticate with Azure
az login

# Check your subscription
az account show
```

### Kernel Issues in Jupyter
- Ensure your virtual environment is selected as the kernel
- Restart the kernel: `Kernel > Restart Kernel`
- Clear outputs and rerun: `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`
