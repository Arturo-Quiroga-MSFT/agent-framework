    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Executors and Edges\n",
    "- ✅ Create executors as classes or functions\n",
    "- ✅ Connect nodes with `add_edge()`\n",
    "- ✅ Use `WorkflowContext` to send messages and yield outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Agents in Workflows\n",
    "- ✅ Integrate AI agents as workflow nodes\n",
    "- ✅ Chain multiple agents together\n",
    "- ✅ Collect outputs from terminal nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Streaming\n",
    "- ✅ Monitor workflows in real-time with `run_stream()`\n",
    "- ✅ Handle different event types\n",
    "- ✅ Track workflow state changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore more complex workflow patterns with branching and conditions\n",
    "- Add error handling and retry logic\n",
    "- Integrate custom tools and external APIs\n",
    "- Build multi-agent systems with specialized roles"
