      "Agent: Certainly! **Microsoft Agent Framework** refers to a set of technologies and software components provided by Microsoft for the creation of interactive, animated characters (called **agents**) that can interact with users, mainly through speech and text. These agents were intended to make software interfaces more friendly, engaging, and accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Points\n",
      "\n",
      "### Background\n",
      "- **Introduced:** Microsoft Agent was released in the late 1990s, primarily for Windows operating systems (Windows 98/XP/2000, etc.).\n",
      "- **Components:** The framework included an API for software developers, character design tools, speech engines, and sample animated characters (like the well-known \"Clippy\" in Microsoft Office).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Features\n",
      "- **Animated Characters**: Characters could perform animations, display emotions, and even move across the screen.\n",
      "- **Speech Recognition & Synthesis**: Integration with the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), allowing agents to recognize spoken commands and reply with synthesized speech.\n",
      "- **Text Interaction**: Agents could process user input through text, providing responses and information.\n",
      "- **Programmability**: Developers could embed agents into their applications, websites (with ActiveX), or even custom interfaces using VBScript, Visual Basic, or C++.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Use Cases\n",
      "- **Application Help**: Agents could guide users through tasks, offering help and tips (e.g., Office Assistant — Clippy).\n",
      "- **Educational Software**: Used to make learning software more interactive.\n",
      "- **Entertainment**: Simple games or storytelling applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discontinuation\n",
      "- **End of Support**: Microsoft Agent was discontinued with Windows 7, as modern UI paradigms replaced the approach.\n",
      "- **Legacy**: The concept paved the way for modern *virtual assistants* such as Cortana, Siri, Alexa, etc. Additionally, it influenced advancements in conversational AI, chatbots, and natural UI design.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Related Technologies\n",
      "- **Microsoft Speech API (SAPI)**\n",
      "- **Windows Forms Animation**\n",
      "- **Cortana (Modern Virtual Assistant)**\n",
      "\n",
      "## Resources\n",
      "- [Official Microsoft Agent documentation (archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20100104223116/http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/)\n",
      "- [Wikipedia: Microsoft Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Agent)\n",
