    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Environment Configuration** - Loading credentials from `.env` file\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Real Weather API** - Integration with OpenWeatherMap for actual weather data\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **AI Agent Creation** - Building a ChatAgent with Azure OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Function Calling** - Agent automatically calls weather tools when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Natural Conversation** - Interactive, context-aware weather assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Multi-turn Dialogue** - Maintaining conversation context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Integration** - Weather functions are registered as agent tools\n",
    "2. **Automatic Invocation** - Agent decides when to call tools based on user queries\n",
    "3. **Real Data** - Using actual APIs instead of mock data\n",
    "4. **Environment Management** - Proper credential handling via `.env`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try It Yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modify the queries in the example cells\n",
    "- Ask about different cities around the world\n",
    "- Try complex queries like \"Compare weather in 3 cities\"\n",
    "- Ask for travel recommendations based on weather\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add more weather-related tools (forecast, air quality, etc.)\n",
    "- Create a web UI using the DevUI framework\n",
    "- Add visualization of weather data\n",
    "- Integrate with travel planning workflows"
